# IP2Decimal-JS
```
This is a very basic JavaScript project that will convert a dot-decimal IP address to decimal format string
this website also validates the IPV4 via regex to ensure the IP address format is correct 
this project also uses the Ipify API & xmlHTTP request to return IP as a place holder :)
